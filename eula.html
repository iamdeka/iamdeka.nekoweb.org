    <h2>End-User License Agreement (EULA) of iamdeka's Direct Messages</h2>
    <p>This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Deka.</p>
    <p>This EULA agreement governs your acquisition and use of my Direct Messages directly from Deka or indirectly through a Deka authorized reseller or distributor (a "Reseller").</p>
    <p>Please read this EULA agreement carefully before completing the message transmission and using the Direct Messages. It provides a license to use the Direct Messages and contains warranty information and liability disclaimers.</p>
    <p>If you use the Direct Messages, this EULA agreement will also govern that. By clicking "send" or using the Direct Messages, you are confirming your acceptance of the Direct Messages and agreeing to become bound by the terms of this EULA agreement.</p>
    <p>If you are entering into this EULA agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these terms and conditions. If you do not have such authority or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this EULA agreement, do not use the Direct Messages, and you must not accept this EULA agreement.</p>
    <p>This EULA agreement shall apply only to the Direct Messages to Deka herewith regardless of whether other Direct Messages are referred to or described herein. The terms also apply to any Deka updates, supplements, Internet-based services, and support services for the Direct Messages, unless other terms accompany those items on delivery. If so, those terms apply.</p>
    <h3>License Grant</h3>
    <p>Deka hereby grants you a personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the Direct Messages on your devices in accordance with the terms of this EULA agreement.</p>
    <p>You are permitted to load the Direct Messages under your control. You are responsible for ensuring your device meets the minimum requirements of the Discord software.</p>
    <p>You are not permitted to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit, alter, modify, adapt, translate or otherwise change the whole or any part of the Direct Messages nor permit the whole or any part of the Direct Messages to be combined with or become incorporated in any other Direct Messages, nor decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer the Direct Messages or attempt to do any such things</li>
      <li>Reproduce, copy, distribute, resell or otherwise use the Direct Messages for any commercial purpose</li>
      <li>Allow any third party to use the Direct Messages on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party</li>
      <li>Use the Direct Messages in any way which breaches any applicable local, national or international law</li>
      <li>Use the Direct Messages for any purpose that Deka considers is a breach of this EULA agreement</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Intellectual Property and Ownership</h3>
    <p>Deka shall at all times retain ownership of the Direct Messages as originally received by you. The Direct Messages (and the copyright, and other intellectual property rights of whatever nature in the Direct Messages, including any modifications made thereto) are and shall remain the property of Deka.</p>
    <p>Deka reserves the right to grant licences to use the Direct Messages to third parties.</p>
    <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
    <p>Most disputes can be resolved informally, so if you have an issue with the services, you agree to reach out to us before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. This requires providing Deka written notice, which must include: your name; the email address or phone number associated with you; a detailed description of the issue, and how you’d like to resolve it.</p>
    <p>If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written notice, you and Deka agree to resolve any remaining dispute through further informal discussions or one of the formal dispute resolution provisions below.</p>
    <p>You must engage in this informal resolution process before starting any formal dispute resolution unless exempted by law.</p>
    <p>Applicable statutes of limitations and due dates for arbitration filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled upon receipt of the written notice to Deka, while the parties attempt informal resolution.</p>
    <p>If you reside in the European Union, you may also be entitled to submit your complaint to the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution Platform or the Out-of-Court Dispute Settlement mechanism under DSA Article 21.</p>
    <p>ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.</p>
    <p>Note that a submission to the ODR or via the OCDS mechanism alone, without submitting a written notice to Deka, will not toll the applicable statutes of limitations or other deadlines.</p>
    <h3>Termination</h3>
    <p>This EULA agreement is effective from the date you first use the Direct Messages and shall continue until terminated. You may terminate it at any time upon written notice to Deka.</p>
    <p>It will also terminate immediately if you fail to comply with any term of this EULA agreement. Upon such termination, the licenses granted by this EULA agreement will immediately terminate and you agree to stop all access and use of the Direct Messages. The provisions that by their nature continue and survive will survive any termination of this EULA agreement.</p>
    <h3>Governing Law</h3>
    <p>This EULA agreement, and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this EULA agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Russia.</p>
